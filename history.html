<div class="textblock"><p>ForceManII was originally a code written to replace Q-Chem's original MM code, which is entitled ForceMan (short for force-field manager). In 2012, I (Ryan M. Richard) started work on a revised updated version which I termed ForceManII. The predominent goal of that rewrite was to add Hessians so that the MM code could be used as a guess for geometry optimizations. This was work that I started as a graduate student at Ohio State (where I was part of the Q-Chem development team) and finished at the beginning of my postdoc at Georgia Institue of Technology (where I became a Psi4 developer). In an effort to still maintain ForceManII, the decision was made to make it a stand alone library that could be called from either Q-Chem or Psi4. This is the result of that rewrite.</p>
<p>From the begining the design considerations of ForceManII are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Designed to be driven not the driver<ul>
<li>Most MM packages assume they are in command as do most QM packages. This leads to a power struggle. ForceManII is designed to be callable either from a more fully featured MM package or a QM package.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Designed to be extensible<ul>
<li>QM/MM computations are becoming exceedingly popular. Newer QM/MM procedures usually impose small modifications to existing procedures, modifications that we aim to allow the user to enforce on us without modifying the code</li>
<li>New force fields or reparameterizations of old ones are common we aim to be able to accomodate thes new developments without having to modify the core of ForceManII</li>
<li>A hot topic in QM methods development is on-the-fly force field parameterization and more physically motivated force fields we strive to provide a scaffolding to faciliate this.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Designed to use modern object-oriented paradigms<ul>
<li>Automation of much of the messy logic plauging older MM codes</li>
<li>Inheritance to reduce code duplication</li>
<li>STL usage for faster/better algorithms</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h2>Versioning</h2>
<h1>Release -1.0 (circa 2013)</h1>
<p>The initial ForceManII project is propietary code in Q-Chem. It includes some nice features such as analytic Hessians, a more object-oriented design, (attempted) means of easily extending, and reading parameters from files. Aside from the ideas of this release nothing remains of it.</p>
<h1>Release 1.0 (currently in pre-alpha)</h1>
<p>This is the first release of ForceManII actually intended for use. The main features are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Support for several force fields<ul>
<li>AMBER99</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>C++11 API that allows a high-level of flexibility on the user's part<ul>
<li>Can use custom force fields and parameters<ul>
<li>Either by manually filling in a <code>ForceField</code> class or by providing such a force field in an std::istream formatted according to Tinker's .prm conventions</li>
<li>Relatedly one may manually tweak the assigned parameters in the <code>ParamSet</code> instance before they are actually used</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Ability to manually define internal coordinates<ul>
<li>User may provide their own filled <code>CoordArray</code> instance</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Disjoint implementations of model potentials and internal coordinates<ul>
<li>Adding a new bond-stretching potential (<em>e.g.</em> a fifth order Taylor series) involvies only adding a new potential. The derivatives coded for the distance between the two points (the internal coordinate) are reusable and need not be recoded. This also works in reverse; to add a new internal coordinate, one need not rederive the potential used for it.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Minimal input (only the Cartesian coordinates of the molecule, the atom types of each atom, and the connectivity are required)<ul>
<li>Future releases aim to reduce this to just the Cartesian coordinates (and the atomic numbers)</li>
<li>Avoids the need for things like topology files, which are unfamiliar to QM people and replaces it with quantities that are commonly found in most QM packages (plus atom types) </li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
