# ForceManII: An MM code for QM people

TODO: Add statuses (code coverage, build testing, etc.)

## History
ForceManII was originally a code written to replace Q-Chem's original MM code, 
which is entitled ForceMan (short for force-field manager).  I (Ryan M. Richard
), started work on ForceManII as a graduate student at Ohio State where I was
part of the Q-Chem development team.  I then went on to do a postdoc at Georgia
 Institue of Technology where I became a Psi4 developer.  In an effort to still maintain ForceManII the decision was made to make it a stand alone library that could be called from either Q-Chem or Psi4.
