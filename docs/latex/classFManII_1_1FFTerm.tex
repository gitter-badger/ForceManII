The class responsible for computing derivatives of a force field term

All energetic terms in a forcefield depend on some generic coordinate $q$, which itself depends on the standard Cartesian coordinates of the system. Consequentially, the first derivative of the energy with respect to one of these coordinates, say $x$ is\+: \[ \frac{\partial E(q)}{\partial x}=\frac{\partial f(q)}{\partial q} \frac{\partial q}{\partial x}, \] where $f(q)$ is the functional form of the term (harmonic oscillator, Fourier series, etc). The second derivative with respect to $x$ and $y$ is then\+: \[ \frac{\partial^2 E(q)}{\partial x\partial y}= \frac{\partial^2 f(q)}{\partial q^2}\frac{\partial q}{\partial x} \frac{\partial q}{\partial y}+ \frac{\partial f(q)}{\partial q} \frac{\partial q^2}{\partial x\partial y} \]

This class is responsible for handeling these derivative manipulations in a generic way. Eventually I probably will want to expand this to include higher-\/order terms like those in the M\+M4 series which involve cross-\/terms between parameters. In those cases the chain rule seen here needs generalized to multiple $q$ and I anticipate there being an additional template type parameter.
