\subsection*{History}

Force\+Man\+II was originally a code written to replace Q-\/\+Chem\textquotesingle{}s original MM code, which is entitled Force\+Man (short for force-\/field manager). I (Ryan M. Richard ), started work on Force\+Man\+II as a graduate student at Ohio State where I was part of the Q-\/\+Chem development team. I then went on to do a postdoc at Georgia Institue of Technology where I became a Psi4 developer. In an effort to still maintain Force\+Man\+II the decision was made to make it a stand alone library that could be called from either Q-\/\+Chem or Psi4.
