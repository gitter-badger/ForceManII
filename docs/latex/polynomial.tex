Many of the forms of force field potentials are that of polynomials. That is they are a linear combination of $N$ terms of the form\+: \[ E=\sum_{i=1}^Nc_ix^{p_i} \] where $c_i$ is the weight of the $i$-\/th term which has the exponet $p_i$. In general $p_i$ can be positive (say $p_i=2$ for the harmonic oscillator) or negative (say $p_i=-1$ for point-\/charge, point-\/charge interactions). The gradient is\+: \[ \frac{\partial E}{\partial x}=\sum_{i=1}^N c_ip_i x^{p_i-1} \] and the Hessian is\+: \[ \frac{\partial^2 E}{\partial x^2}=\sum_{i=1}^N c_ip_i(P_i-1)x^{p_i-2} \]
